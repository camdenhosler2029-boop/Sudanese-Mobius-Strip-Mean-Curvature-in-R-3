## Overview
This project constructs the Sudanese Möbius strip in $S^3$ using the Lawson parameterization, stereographically projects it into $\mathbb{R}^3$, and visualizes the induced mean and Gaussian curvature. Although stereographic projection is conformal, it is not isometric; distances are therefore not preserved, and changes in both mean curvature and Gaussian curvature are expected. 

The mean curvature measures how the surface bends in space and is sensitive to both stereographic projection and the surface's orientation in $S^3$. In contrast, Gaussian curvature is intrinsic to the surface and depends only on distances along it; its distortion arises solely from the non-isometric nature of the projection and is unaffected by rotation in $S^3$. 

The mean curvature is still included to illustrate the surface's bending in space, though its precise values depend on the surface's orientation in $S^3$ and therefore are somewhat rotation-dependent. In contrast, Gaussian curvature provides a rotation-independent measure of intrinsic distortion.

This project focuses on numerical visualization and geometric interpretation rather than closed-form curvature analysis.

## Mathematical Background

**Sudanese Mobius Strip**

The Sudanese Mobius Strip is a minimal surface in $S^3$ orginally parameterized by Lawson.

**Stereographic Projection**

The Stereographic Projection is calculated as below

$$ 
X_s = \frac{X_1}{1 - X_4}
Y_s = \frac{X_2}{1 - X_4}
Z_s = \frac{X_3}{1 - X_4} $$

**Rotation in $S^3$**

The below matrix was used to rotate the surface in $S^3$ before projection

$$
\frac{1}{2}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -1 & -1 & -1 \\
1 & 1 & -1 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & -1 \\
1 & -1 & 1 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

This matrix performs a rotation in $\mathbb{R}^4$ that reorients the Sudanese Möbius strip in $S^3$. 
It helps move the surface away from singularities (e.g., near the poles) and prepares it for stereographic projection into $\mathbb{R}^3$. The factor of $1/2$ ensures that the transformation preserves scale appropriately.

**Curvature**

For both of the following calculations the coefficients are equal since they are both in $\mathbb{R}^3$

The First Fundamental Form is given by

$$I =
\begin{bmatrix}
E & F \\
F & G
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{x}_u \cdot \mathbf{x}_u & \mathbf{x}_u \cdot \mathbf{x}_v \\
\mathbf{x}_u \cdot \mathbf{x}_v & \mathbf{x}_v \cdot \mathbf{x}_v
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The Second Fundamental Form is given by

$$
II =
\begin{bmatrix}
L & M \\
M & N
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{x}_{uu} \cdot \mathbf{n} & \mathbf{x}_{uv} \cdot \mathbf{n} \\
\mathbf{x}_{uv} \cdot \mathbf{n} & \mathbf{x}_{vv} \cdot \mathbf{n}
\end{bmatrix}
$$


The surface's mean curvature in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is written as $H$ and is calculated as shown below

$H = \frac{LG - 2MF + NE}{2(EG - F^2)}$.

The surface's Gaussian curvature in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is written as $K$ and is calculated as shown below

$K = \frac{LN - M**2}{(EG - F^2)}$.



## Upcoming
The next step will compute Gaussian curvature on the surface in $S^3$ using the first fundamental form of the parameterization. Comparing this to the projected surface will quantify intrinsic distortion. The readme will be updated when this is finished.
